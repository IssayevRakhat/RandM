## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Listen, put it pause and skip to previous or next song
- See all animations and interract with them

### What I learned

Our team Rakhat and me, Miras, have learned a lot about interacting with music and audio section of HTML5, how to deal with it on JS and CSS3. We discovered and used local storage for simulation of login and registration sessions and for adding music to playlist of favourite ones. We hope, in the future we would show our best and develop our work more and do it for mass use

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

In our plans we want to do more interactive website for music listening, and for it working more smoothly without any bugs and mistakes. We want to go further than local storage to go further than limits of this browser storage, we plan to add more serious data base for data of users and music.
